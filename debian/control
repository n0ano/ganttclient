Description: Nova Cloud Computing - common files
 Nova is a cloud computing fabric controller (the main part of an IaaS
 system) built to match the popular AWS EC2 and S3 APIs. It is written in
 Python, using the Tornado and Twisted frameworks, and relies on the
 standard AMQP messaging protocol, and the Redis distributed KVS.
 .
 Nova is intended to be easy to extend, and adapt. For example, it
 currently uses an LDAP server for users and groups, but also includes a
 fake LDAP server, that stores data in Redis. It has extensive test
 coverage, and uses the Sphinx toolkit (the same as Python itself) for code
 and user documentation.
 .
 While Nova is currently in Beta use within several organizations, the
 codebase is very much under active development.
 .
 This package contains things that are needed by all parts of Nova.
